# Distant-Operated-Robotic-Vehicle
    # Designed and implemented a prototype of a remotely operated robotic vehicle capable of transmitting real-time video from incident areas using an onboard camera.
    # Enabled the robot to navigate rough terrains and recover from being overturned.
    # Implemented web-based control, allowing global operation via the internet.
    # Powered the system using a 10,000 mAh portable battery for the Raspberry Pi and a lithium battery for high current gear motors.
    # Integrated obstacle detection, issuing warnings if the distance is less than 10 cm and detecting motion from moving obstacles.
# Technology: Raspberry Pi Computer, Raspbian Jessie, Python, Bash Script, HTML, CSS3, JavaScript
